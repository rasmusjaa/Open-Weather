# Open-Weather

Demo: https://weather.lense.fi/

Get current weather in Helsinki or another city. 

Uses OpenWeatherMap API (free plan with max 60 calls per minute) to get current weather data for city and display it on a dark mobile-first design. No page loads needed and built without ajax, just jQuery, JS and CSS. 

Helsinki, Finland is default view, but I might change it to find user location later.
